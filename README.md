# Velocity
Velocity is a high speed, highly intelligent multipurpose bot. Velocity makes use of all new Discord integrations including slash commands, buttons, auto complete and more!

# Contributions

Contributions can be made via pull-requests. When making contributions, you must ensure that you specify exactly what has been added. If you are adding a command, you must attach a gif/image of the command in use so that we know exactly how it works.
Any commands being created must be simplistic, if not we will request that changes are made.

You can always ask us if you are unsure of something via the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/DFa5wNFWgP).
